Library Lab "Do we own this?" app v1.0
chip goines (chip_goines@harvard.edu)  7 Aug 13

These are the instructions on how to setup your build enviroment for the "do we own this?" mobile app.
Since it requires the use of the PhoneGap barcode scanner plugin, you will have to make a device-specific
build in PhoneGap in order for this app to work.  It is currently built for an ios target, if you would 
like to build for another platform, follow the directions below and create a PG app for your target instead
of ios.

Required software:
--------------------
- Sencha Touch v 2.2.1 or higher
	http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/
- Sencha Cmd v 3.1.2 or higher
	http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download
- PhoneGap (apache cordova) v 2.9.0 or higher
	https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/archive/2.9.0.zip
- apache cordova plugman (phonegap plugin mgr)
	https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman
- PhoneGap barcode scanner plugin 
	https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner
- Node.js v 0.10 or higher (npm for installing aforementioned software)
	http://nodejs.org/

Setup instructions:
---------------------
0) install node.js if it's not already installed
1) install sencha touch
2) install sencha cmd
3) install phonegap
4) create a sencha app by typing "sencha generate app doweown /build_directory_of_doweown"
5) in the sencha app directory, type "sencha app build package"
6) type "cd doweown/build" then type "./create doweown/build/doweown/ios edu.harvard.hul.liblab doweown"
7) plugman install --platform ios --project /path-to/doweown/build/doweown/ios --plugin https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner.git
8) copy cordova.js and barcodescanner.js from the phonegap ios directory to the root of the sencha touch app directory
9) edit app.json and include cordova.js and barcodescanner.js above the entry for app.js
10) add this target in the build.xml file in the sencha root folder:

<target name="-after-build">
                <!-- delete contents of phonegap ios web root -->
                <delete dir="${build.dir}/ios/www"/>

                <!-- copy sencha page to phonegap ios web root -->
                <copy todir="${build.dir}/ios/www">
                        <fileset dir="${build.dir}/package"/>
                </copy>
</target>

11) run "sencha app build package" at the sencha app root directory
  optionally, you can point your browser at http://sencha app root/doweown/build/doweown/package/ to see the optimized html mobile ui 
  before it is built into an app. It will not be able to access the barcode scanner.
12) build your native app inside xcode or the android apk
13) your native app should now run inside an emulator or on the device.

nb: please refer to Brice Mason's "Building iOS Applications with Sencha Touch
	and PhoneGap" (https://vimeo.com/55148644) for more details on how to link sencha w/ phonegap.


Build notes:
-------------
-- the js console may give a 404 error on "cordova_plugins.json". you can either create an empty file in the phonegap build or ignore it.
